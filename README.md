# SnakeGame

I made a quick app that you can execute on your machine, recreating the classic snake game. The purpose was to get used to quickly explore Java's swing library to make a desktop app.

To run it on your own computer, you first need to download the executable Snake.jar file Then using your terminal change to the directory that contains the jar file and execute the following command:

```
java -jar Snake.jar
```
Alternatively you can also give a path to the file as well

```
java -jar <Path to directory>/Snake.jar
```
You must have a working installation of java for this to work properly.
